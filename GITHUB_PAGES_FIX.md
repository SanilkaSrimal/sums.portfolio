# 🔧 GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## ❌ Problem Solved!

The error you encountered:
```
GET https://dilmij.github.io/src/main.jsx net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)
```

This happened because GitHub Pages serves your site from `https://username.github.io/repository-name/` but the build was looking for files at the root.

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've fixed this by:

1. **Updated `vite.config.js`** with the correct base path:
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/Portfolio/', // This fixes the path issue
})
```

2. **Rebuilt the project** with correct paths
3. **Created GitHub Actions workflow** for automatic deployment

## 🚀 How to Deploy Now

### Option 1: Manual Upload (Quick Fix)
1. Download the new `dist` folder from your project
2. Go to your GitHub repository
3. Delete old files and upload the new `dist` folder contents
4. Your site should work at `https://dilmij.github.io/Portfolio/`

### Option 2: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Push all project files** to your GitHub repository
2. **Go to Settings → Pages** in your GitHub repo
3. **Select "GitHub Actions"** as the source
4. **Add environment variables** (if you want email to work):
   - Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add these secrets:
     - `VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`
     - `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
     - `VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`

5. **Push to main branch** - GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy!

## 📁 What Changed

### Before (Broken):
```html
<script src="/assets/index-xxx.js"></script>  <!-- Wrong path -->
```

### After (Fixed):
```html
<script src="/Portfolio/assets/index-xxx.js"></script>  <!-- Correct path -->
```

## 🎯 Repository Name Important!

If your GitHub repository is NOT named "Portfolio", update `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
base: '/your-actual-repo-name/',
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
npm run build
```

## ✅ Verification

After deployment, your portfolio should be accessible at:
- **URL**: `https://dilmij.github.io/Portfolio/`
- **All assets loading correctly**
- **No 404 errors**
- **Full functionality working**

## 🔄 If You Still Have Issues

1. **Check repository name** matches the base path in `vite.config.js`
2. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Wait a few minutes** for GitHub Pages to update
4. **Check GitHub Actions** tab for build status

## 📱 Test Your Fixed Site

Once deployed, test:
- ✅ Homepage loads
- ✅ All sections visible
- ✅ Animations working
- ✅ Skills icons showing
- ✅ Contact form functional
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ No console errors

## 🎉 Success!

Your portfolio is now properly configured for GitHub Pages and should work perfectly!

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy using one of the methods above
2. Test your live site
3. Share your portfolio URL with the world!

Your professional portfolio is ready to showcase your amazing work! 🚀
